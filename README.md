# WebDev-Angular

## Open 
The committer opened the folder via Visual Studio Code, open terminal and enter:"ng serve --open"

## JSON Library
Mock server was created to simplify the projects with simple database library. It could be access by propping up another terminal 
and enter: "json-server db.json"

This is an unfinished project with the purpose to familiarize myself with Angular and TypeScript programming language such that 
it could be further applied in future applications.
